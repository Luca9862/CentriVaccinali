# CentriVaccinali
University project

This Java-based project is a management system for vaccination centers. It allows the registration and organization of multiple vaccination centers, each identified by details such as city, address, and name. Citizens can register to their assigned center after receiving a vaccination, using a unique ID. Through this system, they can anonymously submit feedback or reports on any adverse events experienced post-vaccination, functioning as a form of anonymous survey.

The program can be launched through an IDE (such as IntelliJ) or by opening the bat file located in the path: out/artifacts/eseguibile.bat
